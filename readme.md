# Weather, in your statusline

There is a little bit of work to set this up.

1) Set up open weather maps
Go to weather\_sync.d and goto line 17 and 18, fill your city id, and api key from openweather map

2) Type make install

3) Add the following line to your .bashrc
`source ~/.bash-powerline.sh`


This work was heavily inspired by [this project](https://github.com/riobard/bash-powerline), and it was used as the bash starting point
